**Advantages**:
- **High Stability**: With two parallel hulls, the catamaran offers superior stability, reducing rolling and pitching.
- **Large Deck Space**: Allows for the installation of multiple devices and sensors.
- **Higher Speed**: Reduced water resistance enables the vessel to move faster.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Higher Cost**: The more complex design can increase manufacturing and maintenance costs.
- **Larger Size**: May face difficulties maneuvering in narrow spaces or shallow waters.

## 2. Kayak

**Advantages**:
- **Low Cost**: Easy to build and inexpensive.
- **Easy to Maneuver**: Suitable for navigating shallow and narrow waters.
- **Compact and Flexible**: Easy to transport and store.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Low Stability**: Prone to capsizing and significant rolling in rough waters.
- **Limited Space**: Insufficient room for installing necessary monitoring equipment and sensors.
- **Slower Speed**: Single-hull design typically results in slower movement compared to catamarans.

## 3. Trimaran

**Advantages**:
- **Very Stable**: The three-hull design offers even greater stability than catamarans.
- **Large Deck Space**: Provides ample space for equipment installation.
- **High Speed**: The design reduces water resistance, allowing for higher speeds.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Highest Cost**: Most complex design and construction, leading to higher costs.
- **Large Size**: Difficult to maneuver in narrow spaces or shallow waters.

## Conclusion

### Reasons for Choosing Catamaran for the USV Project

- **Stability and Accuracy**: The catamaran offers high stability, ensuring sensors work efficiently and collect high-quality data on coral conditions.
- **Adequate Space**: The large deck space of a catamaran allows for the installation of all necessary monitoring equipment.
- **Reasonable Speed**: The catamaran can move faster than a kayak and almost as fast as a trimaran, saving time when covering large areas.

### Comparison

- **Catamaran**: Optimal choice for stability, space, and speed. The disadvantages of higher cost and larger size are outweighed by its benefits.
- **Kayak**: Suitable for simple tasks and low budgets but doesn't meet high stability and space requirements.
- **Trimaran**: Offers superior stability and space but at a much higher cost and size, making it more suitable for larger, high-demand projects.

Based on these factors, the catamaran design is the most appropriate choice for the USV coral quality monitoring project in Nha Trang Bay, ensuring effective and accurate monitoring to protect and sustain this valuable marine ecosystem.
